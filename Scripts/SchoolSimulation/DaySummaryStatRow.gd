## One line of the Daily Results card: a white stat icon and a gold
## chevron sitting ON TOP of a dark track, with "+12/65" right-aligned
## on the card fill beside it. The chevron shows only on a day that
## actually gained points for this stat -- see shows_chevron.
##
## The track's right edge is the number's left edge -- in the mockup a
## wider number ("+12/65") pushes the track shorter than a narrow one
## ("+9/65"). That falls out of the anchors below: the number is
## right-aligned and shrink-sized, the track expands into what is left.

## Geometry in game pixels, measured off the mockup (spec section 2).

## gain -- a stat that did not move, or that lost ground, shows the bare

##
## The chevron is an absolutely-anchored overlay on the track, so hiding
## it reflows nothing: the icon and the number stay exactly where they are.
