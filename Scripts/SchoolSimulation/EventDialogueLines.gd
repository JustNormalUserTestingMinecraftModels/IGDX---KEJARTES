## Every variation of every EventDialogue and MinigameWinScreen line
## (2026-09-29 dialogue-variations spec): at least five per speaker per pool,
## in each speaker's own voice, in KBBI-checked Indonesian. Pure data;
## EventDialogueCatalog picks from it and falls back to an entry's own `line`
## when a pool is missing. The lines are drafts for the owner's writer.
##
## Rules every line keeps (tests/test_event_dialogue_lines.gd): ASCII only,
## no chat spellings (nggak, udah, aja...), students say "Pak" and never
## {nama}, CHOICE lines end in "?", event lines <= 120 characters, win lines
## fit two lines of the win bubble.

## event key -> {student name -> lines}. The featured student speaks.
const STUDENT_LINES := {}

## event key -> lines, for the NPC-voiced entries and the Hujan narrator.
## {nama} is the featured student.
const NPC_LINES := {}

## student name -> {category -> lines}: their thanks on the win screen.
const WIN_STUDENT_LINES := {}

## category -> lines: the subject teacher's thanks on the win screen
## ("Olahraga" is Guru Penjas, "SeniBudaya" is Guru Seni Budaya).
const WIN_TEACHER_LINES := {}
